# TryCorder

Recently I had a Twitter conversation about the over-reliance on `try` in the Rails community, rather than folks using a NullObject pattern. It is a straight-forward task to search a codebase for uses of `try`, but I was more interested in which classes it was being called on. This gem creates a singleton for counting each use, and provides a method (`report`) for producing a running total.

This code is very much a proof-of-concept, and should NOT be run in production. I've been using it during test runs to get a _sense_ of how a given Rails application is employing the method, and as a precursor to writing a more interesting method usage tracking tool.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'try_corder'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install try_corder

## Usage

Include the reporting output in your rspec helper file like so:

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.after(:suite) do
    TryCorder::Reporter.report
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
